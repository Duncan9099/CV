Last year I started a website using Shopify's platform to sell wooden glasses online.  I imported the glasses, cases and packaging from several Chinese manufacturers, and used Shopify's platforms to sell to customers in Hong Kong and Singapore.  Dachshund Sunglasses (please forgive the name) was where I was first introducted to coding.  Shopify's website allowed me to alter the HTML and CSS on my page.  I quickly became interested in learning more about programming and after extensive research and conversations with some friends in software development I enrolled myself in Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive software development bootcamp which focused on teaching concepts such as object-orientated programming, pair programming, TDD and agile process. 

I am now looking for a junior role as a full stack developer at a company that will help me expand and consolidate my programming knowledge.

Prior to joining Makers, I was working at HSBC as a Premier Relationship Officer. My role as a Premier Relationship Officer included onboarding new customers, processing telegraphic transfers and assisting existing clients with their personal banking needs.  In order to perform well in my role I developed key skills in communication, problem solving, and analytical thinking.

**Technologies**: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, ReactJS, React Native, Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cypress, PostgreSQL, Sinatra

#### Problem Solving
At HSBC Expat I was assisted in increasing lines of communication between our internal account opening teams to help increase our straight through processing (STP) rates for account opening by around 25%.  This helped our teams increase the number of account openings significantly as a result of the increased STP rates.

#### Analytical Thinking

At CLSA I undertook a project to assess the feasability of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity on cryptocurrency exchanges.  The opportunity primarily existed between Korean exchanges and International exchanges due to popularity of cryptocurrencies and existing capital controls in Korea.  I assessed the best method to exploit the opporunity and the requirements that we would potentially need to proceed and submitted my report to the Head of CLSA Research Hong Kong.
