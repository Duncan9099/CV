Last year I started a website using Shopify's platform to sell wooden glasses online.  I imported the glasses, cases and packaging from several Chinese manufacturers, and used Shopify's platforms to sell to customers in Hong Kong and Singapore.  Dachshund Sunglasses (please forgive the name) was where I was first introducted to coding.  Shopify's website allowed me to alter the HTML and CSS on my page.  I quickly became interested in learning more about programming and after extensive research and conversations with some friends in software development I enrolled myself in Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive software development bootcamp which focused on teaching concepts such as object-orientated programming, pair programming, TDD and agile process. 

I am now looking for a junior role as a full stack developer at a company that will help me expand and consolidate my programming knowledge.

Prior to joining Makers, I was working at HSBC as a Premier Relationship Officer. My role as a Premier Relationship Officer included onboarding new customers, processing telegraphic transfers and assisting existing clients with their personal banking needs.  In order to perform well in my role I developed key skills in communication, problem solving, and analytical thinking.

**Technologies**: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, ReactJS, React Native, Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cypress, PostgreSQL, Sinatra

## Experience

**HSBC Expat** (09.2018 to 08.2019)
*Premier Relationship Officer*
At HSBC Expat I was assisted in increasing lines of communication between our internal account opening teams to help increase our straight through processing (STP) rates for account opening by around 25%.  This helped our teams increase the number of account openings significantly as a result of the increased STP rates.  One of my roles at HSBC was to perform decision in principle calls with our mortgage customers, this required strong communication skills from me as I had to explain in clear terms the problems, solutions and any risks involved with the transaction at hand.  This skill has been invaluable in my programming experience in pair programming and team/agile processes as I am required to succinctly explain my thought process to my partner.

**Lexington Partners** (02.2018 to 05.2018)   
*Research Intern* 
My role at Lexington Partners was to carry out industry research on sectors with potential investment opportunities which I then presented the research to senior partners in the firm to guide their investment decisions.  To avoid making mistakes in my research, I had to have a strict methodical process.  This has been a fundamental skill for me in software development especially when faced with problems and TDD. By taking a step back and applying critical thinking I am able to break down a problem and find a fresh approach to solve the issue.

**CLSA** (01.2018 to 02.2018)
*Research Intern* 
At CLSA I undertook a project to assess the feasability of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity on cryptocurrency exchanges.  The opportunity primarily existed between Korean exchanges and International exchanges due to popularity of cryptocurrencies and existing capital controls in Korea.  I assessed the best method to exploit the opporunity and the requirements that we would potentially need to proceed and submitted my report to the Head of CLSA Research Hong Kong.  Part of my role also included writing daily newsletters, this required a keen attention to detail as it was distributed to all members of staff in the company.  This skill has been invaluable in my development in coding, especially in my debugging process as I have been able to focus on the details of the problem to gain visibility.

**Aglaia Family Office** (07.2017 to 12.2017)
*Research Intern*
At Aglaia I compiled reports on technology startups and venture capital funds focused mainly on big data, 3D printing, computer vision and machine learning
