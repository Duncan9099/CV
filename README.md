I am an enthusiastic learner currently enrolled in a Makers Academy's 12-week intensive development bootcamp with the aspiration to take on  a role as a Junior Full Stack Developer.

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in July 2017 and my most recent role was with HSBC as a Premier Relationship Officer. My role as a Premier Relationship Officer included onboarding new customers, processing telegraphic transfers and assisting existing clients with their personal banking needs.  Over the past two years I have had the opportunity to intern at several firms including a private equity firm, a brokerage and a family office.  Work experience at the above firms has helped me develop key skills in problem solving, analytical thinking and organization.

**Technologies**: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, ReactJS, Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cypress, PostgreSQL, Sinatra

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
At HSBC Expat I was assisted in increasing lines of communication between our internal account opening teams to help increase our straight through processing (STP) rates for account opening by around 25%.  This helped our teams increase the number of account openings significantly as a result of the increased STP rates.

#### Analytical Thinking

At CLSA I undertook a project to assess the feasability of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity on cryptocurrency exchanges.  The opportunity primarily existed between Korean exchanges and International exchanges due to popularity of cryptocurrencies and existing capital controls in Korea.  I assessed the best method to exploit the opporunity and the requirements that we would potentially need to proceed and submitted my report to the Head of CLSA Research Hong Kong.

#### Self Starter/innovation
Last year I started a website using Shopify's platform to sell wooden glasses online.  I imported the glasses, cases and packaging from several Chinese manufacturers, and used Shopify's platforms to sell to customers in Hong Kong and Singapore.  I used the opportunity to learn basic HTML and CSS to help customise the website.
